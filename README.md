<h1>Object Recognition in Photographs</h1>
<p>The problem of automatically identifying objects in photographs is difficult because of the near
infinite number of permutations of objects, positions, lighting and so on. Itâ€™s a really hard
problem. This is a well studied problem in computer vision and more recently an important
demonstration of the capability of deep learning. A standard computer vision and deep learning
dataset for this problem was developed by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research
(CIFAR)</p>
